(:","group":"Antler","keywords":["antler"],"dependencies":[],"host_dependencies":["Revit"],"contents":"AssureNumber - Makes sure that the input is a number. Strings are converted to floats or integers, and numbers are returned unharmed., All open Documents - Gets all open documents, including Links., DynamoCustomPackageFolders - Gets all custom package folders stored in DynamoSettings.xml., ExtractElementSurfacesWithMaterials - Extracts surfaces from input element with a parallel list of materials for each surface., ExtractNumbers - Extracts numbers from string., GetTransform - Gets Transform of FamilyInstance as a Coordinate System., FilteredElementCollector - Collects all elements of multiple categories. Provide category names as strings., FindSubfoldersByName - Finds subfolders in input folder with given name. Node will search recursively and return all folders with given name., GetAntlerLibFolders - Utility function to return the library folder for the Antler package. This folder contains python libraries necessary to run some its components., GetElementsNearCurve - Returns Elements which are intersecting or near a curve. Radius parameter defines how far from curve to find elements. Categories parameter is optional. , GetFilledRegions - Returns all instances of input filled region type or filled region type name., PipeCurve - Returns a round pipe solid from input curve and radius. Due to bug in Dynamo this node outputs both Revit solids and DesignScript solids. In Dynamo use ds_solid, and if you need the solid in another Python script, use revit_solid., PullPtToPlane - Pulls a point to a plane., QueryReference - Returns Element, Point, Geometry from input Reference., ReferenceIntersectorFind - Returns elements and corresponding geometry found at intersection of ray from input Point and direction Vector., ReferenceIntersectorFindNearest - Returns elements and corresponding geometry found at intersection of ray from input Point and direction Vector., RevitGeometryToDSGeometry - Converts Revit geometry to Dynamo geometry., RoomAtPoint - Collects room at point. Phase is a required parameter to only collect one room., SerializePoint - Serializes a Point to a Dictionary, SetLineStyle -  Sets the line style for all boundaries. , Planar Surface Union - Gets intersection of multiple coplanar surfaces. If surfaces intersect the node will cut away the intersecting part from one of the surfaces., UnfilterByBoolMask - Does the opposite of FilterByBoolMask. It weaves  two lists together based on a bool mask., WeightedMajority - Returns the majority of list based on list of weights.","engine_version":"2.6.1.8850","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"https://github.com/tothom/antler-dynamo","repository_url":"https://github.com/tothom/antler-dynamo","contains_binaries":false,"node_libraries":[]}
