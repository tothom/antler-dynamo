","group":"Antler","keywords":null,"dependencies":[],"host_dependencies":["Revit"],"contents":"DynamoCustomPackageFolders - Gets all custom package folders stored in DynamoSettings.xml., ExtractElementSurfacesWithMaterials - Extracts surfaces from input element with a parallel list of materials for each surface., ExtractNumbers - Extracts numbers from string., GetTransform - Gets Transform of FamilyInstance as a Coordinate System., FindSubfoldersByName - Finds subfolders in input folder with given name. Node will search recursively and return all folders with given name., GetAntlerLibFolders - Utility function to return the library folder for the Antler package. This folder contains python libraries necessary to run some its components., PullPtToPlane - Pulls a point to a plane., QueryReference - Returns Element, Point, Geometry from input Reference., ReferenceIntersectorFind - Returns elements and corresponding geometry found at intersection of ray from input Point and direction Vector., ReferenceIntersectorFindNearest - Returns elements and corresponding geometry found at intersection of ray from input Point and direction Vector., RevitGeometryToDSGeometry - Converts Revit geometry to Dynamo geometry., RoomAtPoint - Collects room at point. Phase is a required parameter to only collect one room., Planar Surface Union - Gets intersection of multiple coplanar surfaces. If surfaces intersect the node will cut away the intersecting part from one of the surfaces.","engine_version":"2.6.1.8850","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"https://github.com/tothom/antler-dynamo","repository_url":"https://github.com/tothom/antler-dynamo","contains_binaries":false,"node_libraries":[]}
