Node will search recursively and return all folders with given name., GetAntlerLibFolders - Utility function to return the library folder for the Antler package. This folder contains python libraries necessary to run some its components., PullPtToPlane - Pulls a point to a plane., ReferenceIntersector - Finds Elements in 3D by input Points and direction. By default the function searches for elements below the points. You must also supply a 3D View and minimum one category to search for. Works similar to RayBounce., RoomAtPoint - Collects room at point. Phase is a required parameter to only collect one room., Planar Surface Union - Gets intersection of multiple coplanar surfaces. If surfaces intersect the node will cut away the intersecting part from one of the surfaces.","engine_version":"2.6.1.8850","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"https://github.com/tothom/antler-dynamo","repository_url":"https://github.com/tothom/antler-dynamo","contains_binaries":false,"node_libraries":[]}
